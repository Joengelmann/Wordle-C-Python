This program is a version of the game wordle. It works by picking a random
secret 5 letter word from a bank and then asks the user to input a guess. Then, 
the program will go through letter by letter determing if a: the the letter is 
in the word and in the right position, b: the letter is in the word but not in
the right positon, or c: the letter is not in the word at all. The goal of the 
game is to guess the secret word and the user has 6 tries to do so.

It has been coded in c++ and in python and uses the wordbank in wordbank.txt.
